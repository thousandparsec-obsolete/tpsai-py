Dealing with RFTS strange even/odd stuff.
 - Create different tasks depending on turn?
 - Always create all tasks but only issue the orders at the right turn

Need to add an explore task.

Need to figure out how you deal with "improvement".
Need a portable way to figure out when a battle is a good idea - impliment Rusty's idea.
