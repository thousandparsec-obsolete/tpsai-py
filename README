How this AI bot works.

* - yet to be implimented

Step 1 - Classify objects in the Universe
			- threats, things which can hurt us
			- neutral, things which we want to obtain
			- assets,  things which we can control
			- *unknown, things which we need to investigate
Step 2 - Do initial pass at assigning tasks
Step 3 - *Run various culling methods
			- Over allocated tasks
			- Under allocated tasks
Step 4 - *Do second pass at assigning tasks
Step 5 - Issue orders to perform tasks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tasks are printed in the following manner

<Task <type> - <thing this task references> ((<???>%) assigned to [
	 [<turns to complete>, <asset>, <percentage>], <-- Asset directly involved
	![<turns to complete>, <asset>, <percentage>], <-- Asset directly involved but can not complete the task by itself
	 {<turns to complete>, <asset>, <percentage>}, <-- Asset indirectly involved

Example:

<Task TakeOver - <Threat refs=[<Planet @ 17>]> ((34%) assigned to [
        (3.89, <Asset refs=[<Fleet @ 15>]>, 2.9), 
        (3.89, <Asset refs=[<Fleet @ 19>]>, 17.1), 
        {13.83, <Asset refs=[<Planet @ 13>]>, 14.3}])>
